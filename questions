Here are some coding questions related to arrays in JavaScript:

1. Find the Maximum and Minimum Elements in an Array
Problem: Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an object containing the maximum and minimum numbers in the array.
Example Input: [3, 5, 7, 2, 8]
Example Output: { max: 8, min: 2 }

2. Reverse an Array
Problem: Write a function that takes an array as input and returns the array in reverse order.
Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Example Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

3. Remove Duplicates from an Array
Problem: Write a function that removes duplicate values from an array and returns the new array.
Example Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Example Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. Rotate an Array
Problem: Write a function that rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps.
Example Input: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
Example Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

5. Find the Intersection of Two Arrays
Problem: Write a function that takes two arrays and returns an array containing the elements that are present in both arrays.
Example Input: ([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6])
Example Output: [3, 4]

6. Find the Missing Number in an Array
Problem: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
Example Input: [3, 0, 1]
Example Output: 2

7. Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Problem: Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
Example Input: ([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
Example Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

8. Find the First Non-Repeating Element in an Array
Problem: Write a function that returns the first non-repeating element in an array.
Example Input: [4, 5, 1, 2, 0, 4]
Example Output: 5

9. Count Occurrences of Each Element in an Array
Problem: Write a function that counts the occurrences of each element in an array and returns an object where the keys are the elements and the values are the counts.
Example Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Example Output: {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}

10. Check if an Array is a Subset of Another Array
Problem: Write a function that checks if one array is a subset of another.
Example Input: ([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3])
Example Output: true4. Rotate an Array
Problem: Write a function that rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps.
Example Input: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
Example Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
